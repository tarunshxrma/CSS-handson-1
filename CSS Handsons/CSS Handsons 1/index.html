    <h2 class="h2">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol class="a">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><b><del>Css is not necessary</del><span class="yel">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><ins>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</ins></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="h2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="b">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an extrenal CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="yel">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a styleto multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also
        <br>special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="d">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or rabge of elements on a web pags. once an element has been 
        targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>element.</p>
        <p class="e">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target 
        element to which a style should be applied.</p>
